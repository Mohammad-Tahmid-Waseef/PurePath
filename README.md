# 🌿 PurePath

**PurePath** is a "truth checker" for sustainability. We use AI to cut through the "marketing fog" and spot greenwashing, the practice of companies pretending to be eco friendly to trick consumers. 

Instead of taking a brand's word for it, PurePath gives you a data backed **Truth Score** in seconds.

## 💡 Inspiration
We were tired of seeing "eco friendly" labels on everything when nearly **80% of corporate sustainability claims** are actually exaggerated or lack verifiable evidence. We built PurePath because if professional investors are confused by greenwashing, regular shoppers don't stand a chance.

## 🛠️ What it Does

* **Verifies**: **Gemini 2.5 Flash** scans news reports, legal filings, and environmental studies for contradictions (e.g., hidden emissions or climate lobbying).
* **Truth Score**: Generates a 0–100 score to help you identify true environmental leaders.
